1.1.15.27

Fixed freezing issue. Maybe. Should be good. Can't test, not playing the game.

1.1.15.26

NoRecoil changes from .24 version altered.
NoSway for streamers still exposes it so it's reverted.
Streamer can use Safe Stream option checkbox and use NoRecoil reduction from drop down (if you don't stream, just keep it off and use normal norecoil)
Refer for help in the Write Memory tab as well.

Fix:
Loot through walls not can be used with long barrels.

1.1.15.25

Grenades on Radar

fix: Aimbot using Bone.Base (between Feet) if all bones were used and only None left at the time of aiming.

1.1.15.24

Pink Dudes reverted to the very original implementation at it proved to be the most stable one.
So we apply chams and re-apply if entity is inside your sight arc.
The only changes kept are:
Some minor bugfixes
We keep emergency depink mode on local player death (you gonna crash anyway so worth trying)
And try to depink everyone if you are at exfil point for a while (again crash may happen, why not to try)
Rest is reverted to original state.

Rectangle is back for overlay and players bones are more thick now.

NoRecoil changes.
We have been asked to make streamer safe mode so:
NoRecoil now have intensity selector from 0% to 100% and you can select what you like best or drop it completely settings to zero.

NoSway now separate option instead being part on NoRecoil.
    You can't have no sway if you move and aim due to that change which is minor at all as when you stop, nosway is applied right away.
    And it also got intensity selector just like NoRecoil.

InstantADS now separate option instead being part on NoRecoil, not stream safe.

Refer for help in the Write Memory tab as well.

1.1.15.23

Aimbot added 2 more custom patterns as I need them personally.
Please redefine your custom pattern settings again if changed as they are void due to changes. Sorry.

PinkDudes
fixed: player not pinkified if hit

tweaks:
players no longer get pinkified if at exfil points if one of two conditions are met:
    you are at exfil point - de pink all players as you're probably extracting
    player is at exfil point - de pink the player as he is probably extracting
    
    only if within 4 meters from exfil point sphere center
    (it applies to all potential exfils, scav and pmc ones)

dead playes should de-pinkify and it may help with crashes

if you die radar will try to do emergency cleanup and de-pink everyone, maybe that will help as well

Keep bak file so you can fallback to previous version.

1.1.15.22

Tweak:
Aimbot Shaky Aim has randomizer strength so you can fine tune it
I suggest use it so you don't always hit same spot fire full auto weapon.

Timescale decreased a bit. I think it causes desyncs sometimes, not bad but I don't like it.

Lean Hack added back with two options. Read Help for more info.

Fixed issues reported by users. Thank you.


1.1.15.21

Added back NoRecoil - turned out its BSG's with no reg.
Added back Loot Through Walls

Lean Hack - if somebody want to try, let us know. It's disabled but I finetuned the distance to even less (you will trade probably legs for lean shot).

1.1.15.20

Elevation arrows back. Sorry it was obscured by another element.
Force Show loot now works correctly.
Solid line of sight setting now saved in settings file right.
Improved Player/Loot iteration, should bug out less
Fixed KD rounding



1.1.15.19

Removed for now:
    LeanHack
    Loot Through Walls
    No Recoil

Pink Dudes
    pinkify based on time and onScreen status
    we try to de-pink then to avoid crashes and pink them back when they're on screen
    will see

1.1.15.18

Item price - shows best price flea vs. trader

Items in Airdrop should get their positions updated once airdrop is deployed on the ground (need to test)

Loot textbox search can be used to filter items by FriendlyName, ShortName or Category now.

Revised Loot setttings UI

AimBot Settings has a warning button with description if you select only one bone.

KillDeathRatio now has a threshold in MainTab
    It will shows KD with red text if it hits the threshold.
    Best way to see potential cheaters.

Boss color selector added

LineOfSight - added solid line checkbox on MainTab

Write Memory settings tab revised, now it remembers some of settings so you don't have to click the buttons every time.

Fixed the dictionary crash issue (I hope). At least I catched the error and fixed what it was.

Added Always Sprint Alt Mode
    It does not requires signature scanning and mutually exclusive with sig scan based Always Sprint.
    It doesn't let you squeeze through bushes but let's you sprint out of them right away.
    (it was added as I suppose that sig scan one causes midgame crashes, this one needs to be tried and tested if it's better crash wise)

1.1.15.15

LeanHack - 0.4f to 0.35f meters for reliability
NoWeaponMalfunctions sets weapon color as well so you know it has been applied
Update data around followed players just like for local player

1.1.15.14

New bosses added as red on the map + nicknames.

1.1.15.13

EFT 0.12.12.30.18876

Loot text bot search can be used also for item Category search

1.1.15.12

Adjusted LeanHack - no more sigscans.
Can aim, use aimbot and all that.
Help button in Write Memory tab revised to give info on how complex stuff works.
Enjoy.

1.1.15.11

Fix:
    Aimbot
        Sometimes stays locked on dead entities until you stop tilting or aiming. (blame eft)

    Boss names are now in English

    Check and mark players as Special color if they got streamer mode enabled (only given by BSG so it's potential legit streamer)

Removed:
    AutomaticGun
        Removed RPM setting.
        Now sets to highesth full and single fire rate guns available in game.
        Renamed to Fast RPM

1.1.15.10 (cumulative change log)

Added:
    Aimbot
        Prioritization by player type 
        Override angle trigger and select closest by distance if threshold was met
        Vertical angle added (so you can chose from circle to rectangle shape trigger area)
        Adjusted UI, settings

        Prediction via object velocity
        Use prediction force to fine tune this

        Switches targets faster now when they die
        
    AutomaticGun
        Adjust Fire Rate

    Lean Hack
        Use sidefire and move your gun right or left using tilt
        Doesn't work with aimbot.
        (i see this as limited utility use, against corner campers, peek hallways safely, try to kill aimbotters from safe place)

    Remove armor penalties
        Remove deaf factor

    UtilityHacks
        All mags now can be loaded and unloaded fast even 60rnd mags
         (they will get green background so you know it works)

    Exfiltration Points
        Show points and update their status from time to time
        See checkbox in MainTab
        (may show exfil as available while they're not, but good to have anyway)

    Sectant priest or bosses
        Have special color and their names on map

    Remove armor movement penalties
        Part of utility hacks
        Removes any rotation and speed limitations (while walking for example).
        Examine item to see if limitations are gone then (they will get green background as well)
        Put item of and on for this to take effect.

Tweaks:
    TimeScale
        Reload speed increased

    Aimbot
        Updates position for you and target on map now.

    Reworked player iteration
        Less CPU consume
        Stale records persist now (not deleted) but not updated and treated as dead
        So if you kill a player you will see player's last location as well as for extracted ones.

    PinkDudes
        Tuned a bit the behavior
        Now only skin chams are applied
        Gear visuals are removed.
        This should help crash less.

    Remove teammates from OSD display

Fix:
    Pink dudes radar crash bug
    Aimbot locking on stale entities
    Correct XY vertical angle calculation
    Show elevation if HideTextAroundPlayer is true
    Overlay black screen sometimes
    OSD shows now only hostile PMC's only
    AlwaysSprint - now removes the sprint block correctly if in a bush.
    Some logical issues giving error screens.

1.1.15.1

Probably fixed 0 ticks loot loading. Some network issues for some users.

Rewised ADS confirmation:
Now all Write Memory settings will not take effect unless you confirm you're in raid via ADS (radar will ask you to do so).
This is to fix issues for some users when they're still loading and radar tries to write memory already.
NoVisor may take up to 5 seconds to take effect and periodically will check if you need visor removed. (don't worry if you click and it's not removed instantly)
Timescale indicator also apperars on OSD if active like fast reload or fast sprinting.

Improved loot loading a little.
Radar will now ignore recursive reading for items that were SPAWNED IN RAID, i.e.
weapons, vests, backpacks and any other round start items that can contain something else will not be read recursively as they probably have trash contents anyway.
It doesn't apply on inventory readings, if scav has a red card, you will see it.

Loot Settings now can stay open and don't block main UI.
If loot is loading, you'll see that on OSD as well.

Added option to hide player related text within certain radius.
See Other tab for settings.

1.1.14.15

Added:
 - UtilityHacks: 
	 No Weapon Jam

 - NightVision (as it works with pink dudes)

Tweaks:
 - Aimbot is a bit faster

1.1.14.14

Updated to match new tool part. So please reinject or use old version.

1.1.14.13

Reverted:
 - Full body player skeleton ESP (no tick loss)
 Needs fixes on player death.

1.1.14.11

Fixed:
- Container loot position.
- Aimbot aiming incorrectly (off player model)
- Tuned NoRecoil (was messing with aimbot aiming)

Added:
- Write memory tickrate

Add:
- Full body player skeleton ESP (no tick loss)

1.1.14.10

Fixed no container loot. Logical bug.

1.1.14.9

I think I have fixed aimbot bone not aiming right. Try test this.
NoRecoil doesn't get along as well, if you get it wrong, disable norecoil, swap weapons (knife will do), swap back and apply again.

Tuned Radar to stop any write memory options if aimbot is locked on. Should be faster.

1.1.14.8

Loot position revise:
 - We try to get loot position easy way (less tick method)
 - If it fails yielding position to be 0,0,0, we try hard way (more ticks) method.
 - If both fails, then loot item is broken or non existant.

ContainedItems and Corpse data read only if loot in containers is on.

Corpses Data:
 - Read Static Data and Inventory Separate ways and only once.

1.1.14.6

Added:
 - PriorityOverPrice column in csv. That will ensure item is shown regardless of price filter. Useful for keys for example.
 - ArmorSlots column in csv. That will show armor class alongside player nickname.

   Get new CSV from site, Radar will fallback to old CSV style if you got an old one.
   If you got custom made csv, just add columns as in new one.

Fix:
 - Corpses
	 Will show TOTAL inventory value on them and PRIORITY items just as for alive players.
	 Since corpses are part of the loot, new dead bodies will appear only on loot refresh or during live loot loading.
     Can be hidden via settings in main tab.
	 Also respects inventory value from players inventory settings.
	 You can hide loot and see corpses with values, remove values and keep just bodies or remove bodies as well via settings in main tab.
	 If you have loot shown, you can see all the loot on them (sadly just all on same line).
	 
1.1.14.5

Show by Value Update:

We have updated how Show by Value works due to EFT banning some items from the Flea Market. 
Going forward we will show Flea Market price if an item is not banned from the Flea Market.
If the item is banned from the Flea Market we will show Trader Buyout Price instead.
The above changes will give us an accurate price of items moving forward. :)
This update uses new CSV data (TraderPrice,BannedOnFlea) (if you got old one it will be reacquired)

1.1.14.4

Fix:
 - FastReload now works with switching weapons.
 - Aimbot keep selected Bone settings on new raid (again, forgot to add the logic itself).

1.1.14.3

Added:

 - Skill Hack
	-- Per skill setting
	-- Reapplies settings on new raid
	-- Now disables right and reverts original skill value. (restarting radar with hack applied voids this statement)

 - NoRecoil
	-- Stays enabled and will ask to ADS once in new raid.

 - More bones into custom pattern.

Fix:

 - Aimbot keep? selected Bone settings on new raid
 - Timescale being not disabled sometimes.
 - ESP now faster a little as it reads only bones it needs than it used to be.

Issues:

 - FastReload may not detect reload right, if you got timescale enabled wrong, re-click FastReload and reload again. Also breaks when switching weapons.
 - Inertia being tested, not disabled sometimes.

Tweaks:
 - Radar initialization status on main screen (wait till it's green)

Removed:
 - No Inertia disabled for now. Breaks game.


1.1.14.2

Misc fixes

1.1.14.1

Added:
 - Always Allow Sprint 
	That will let you sprint no matter what.

 - No Inertia
	Disables all that inertia garbage. YAY!

 - Timescale things:
	Both utilizes Unity

	 -- Fast Reload
		Upon activation radar will ask you to reload to remember some internal data, then you're good to go.
		Every time you reload, timescale will be 2x.

	 -- Fast Sprinting
		Every time you sprint, timescale will be 2x.

	Options work together flawlessly.

Fix:
 - AimBot settings giving errors if OnlyNeck was selected prior.
 - Rare issue when radar was started and was giving zero ticks, but next raid was ok.


1.1.13.17

Added:
 - SkillHack (the ones that are safe)

Tweaks:
 - AimBot prediction tuning
 - PinkDudes should make less burden on network now

1.1.13.16

Added:
 - AimBot simple (dimple) prediction

 Fix:
 - InstantADS works when switching weapons
 - Aimbot now targets selected body parts on new raid correctly
 - Aimbot skips player if it is already died
 - AimBot settings don't block Main UI
 - No PinkDudes for teammates
 - Aimbot revised upper body parts (see tooltip in settings)

 Tweaks:
 - FlyHack now notifies in OSD screen if something is wrong.
 - FlyHack always disabled in lobby.
 - FlyHack reapply rate increased a bit. No effect on how it works but drastical difference for network ticks.

 - NoRecoil also makes all weapons shortest length
 - NoRecoil / InstantADS reapply rate increased a bit. Barely noticeable by end user but drastical difference for network ticks.

1.1.13.15+

Fix:
 - Pink Dudes fixed

1.1.13.15

0.12.12.18103 offsets

1.1.13.14+

Fix:
 - Aimbot now ignores teammates
 - Upper body parts now: head,neck, spine (chest), shoulders

1.1.13.14

Added:
- FlyHack
	Once in raid, click FlyHack and it will be active.
	Flyhack persists between raids. You can enable disable flyhack in raid ONLY. (im lazy to code the logic)

Tweaks:
- PinkDude apply with different delay per players (not all at same time) -> less lags.


Fix:
- Issue when aimbot not initialized and crashed
- Radar crash if overlay is initialized before starting.
- Head and other bone positions being incorrect for ESP and Aimbot. (head on ground etc)

1.1.13.12

Tweaks:
 - AimBot: Now aimbot doesn't drop lock if target moves too fast or you rotate too fast.
	One locked via trigger (aim/tilt) it will follow the target until you stop aiming/tilting.

Fixed:
 - Player levels
 - AimBot: "Only Neck" selecting giving issues (typo lol)
 - NoRecoil now works as before (i.e. no sway while moving). If you got no FastAim, just re-click the button.

1.1.13.11

AIMBOT!

WHAT?

YES!


NoRecoil behavior changed.
- Radar will show a warning that you need aim in game for it to activate. Aimbot requires it to be accurate.
Just click NoRecoil, aim in game and NoRecoil will enable itself. (do that between raids for now)

AimBot settings added.
Trigger by distance, degress (0.1 to whatever you like like 180 lol)
Randomizer - a bit shaky aim idk, some may need it.
Trigger by aiming - you aim, bot snaps.
Trigger by tilt - you do Q or E in game, bot snaps. Keep holding Q or E tho.

Various bone aiming options and even custom patterns.

Report bugs as always.

DON'T ABUSE AIMBOT.
IT'S PROBABLY MOST RISKY SHIT OUTTA HERE.

1.1.13.9 hotfix

You can see if player has priority4 = ultra or priority5 = super items.
You will see it on the right from value.

1.1.13.9

Inventory Reader added

In Main tab there is a checkboxes:
Inventory Value - it works snow.

If enabled roundstart or midraid it will read all players inventory + new spawned ones.
Right now it's done only once.

Inventory Use Loot Filter
It will apply filtering based on loot filter rules.
Priority vs Price Average.
Priority - count only items that match priority settings and add their PriceAverage to the total iventory value.
Price Average - count only items that match Price Average settings and add their PriceAverage to the total iventory value.

1.1.13.8

Here's Johnny
0.12.12.17861
autodump

1.1.13.7

Loot through walls - removed 4 meters from the dropdown, now 3 is max.
Unlimited Stamina seems safe, so now it' refilled at 40% vs 2%.
Better player level calculation.

1.1.13.6

Loot through walls option.
A bit dirty implementation but here we go.
It works by moving your camera forward XX meters keeping your real position intact. (see Memory tab there is also help button with info now)

1.1.13.5

Thanks for testing.

1.1.13.4

Test Version

1.1.13.3

Added Kill Death ratio and Health percentage.
Look at Main tab for options.
Only shown for PMCs. (lmk if you need it for others)

Health is shown and updated only when you look at the desired player for a half-second. (your line should cross player icon +-10 degrees)

1.1.13.2

Fix: Radar not cleaning up properly on death

1.1.13.1

Tweaked PinkDudes feature.

Before: you shoot at the pink entity - it goes gray after, cool but not cool.

After: radar now remembers who you were looking at for a while and reskins grayed one to be pink again around 2 seconds after.

We can't do pinkify based on cooldown as it kills network ticks so we gotta implement something clever.

Try it.
Keep backups as always.

1.1.12.28

Added new write memory feature - Pink Dudes.

When you click it radar will lag a little and make all players pink in the real game so you can see them at night without need for thermals or something.

Report issues as always.

1.1.12.22

Added options in Other tab:
- Opacity
- Always on Top 

Added options in Overlay tab:
- Moonlight support

Use Fullscreen if playing fullscreen mode via moonlight or Moonlight windowed is you use windowed mode.

Apply right resolution and adjust moonlight window to avoid black bars (Stretch the window diagonally.) 

1.1.12.21

Added option to always show loot price regardless of ShowByValue setting.
Some users wanted to keep Priority based filtering but also an ability to see item pricces as well.
Sorry I forgot about it and never did in time. :D

1.1.12.20

0.12.12.16909 patch

1.1.12.19

0.12.12.16778 patch

1.1.12.18

0.12.12.16751 patch

1.1.12.17

fix: allow users see prices even if they use priority based filtering
fix: refresh loot button is now always shown

1.1.12.16


Some error fixes. Thank you guys for reporting errors.

1.1.12.15

Refactor and some tweaks 5heads.
Added better error handler.

1.1.12.12

Adressing 'Collection was modified' bug... maybe

1.1.12.10

Aight folks
I fixed some OpenGL bugs that may help with REDX issue or not. (Lol really I don't have that one so it's pain to fix it.)
Added - OpenGL exception toggle in Debug Tab
If you still keep getting it, tick that and play, the error will popup, I need that error thing.
Try also turning debug log that can generate extra logs.

Also rewised offset system, so I'll enable it shortly so you don't have to download who exe if just offsets get update.

Keep old version in case this one bugs out.

1.1.12.9

0.12.12.16415 patch


1.1.12.8+

Added Santa to show as RED on map with SANTA nickname.

1.1.12.8

Added No Fall Damage - click it and never break your legs ever again.
Added Unlimited Stamina - run, let it drop to almost zero and see it restoring quickly (safe measure ya know)

No Fall Damage - is server sided. Removed for now util I find better way.

1.1.12.7

Added 1000m slider to players / loot
Sorry folks for this being late.

1.1.12.5

FPS Camera + Thermal/Visor/ESP should be working right.
Added OSD indicators, both should be green.

1.1.12.4


Increased search limit for some ingame objects. Should help black screens.

1.1.12.3


New offsets in the app.
Auto offset update disabled (need to do some LGBTQWERTY+ stuff in the code).

1.1.12.2

Fixed offsets not applying on the fly.

1.1.12.0

Introduced separate offsets file.
Offsets update shall no longer force end user to redownload the whole application saving download times and server load.
Offsets are applied on the fly and toast will appear on bottom right of the screen.
Any error will simply fallback to the default offsets built in exe so no harm will be done.

For core changes in the app a redownload is still required.
TODO : Different alert for new app version.

1.1.11.12

Autobuild

Trace Log now disabled by default - See Debug tab for the TraceLog toggle.

1.1.11.11

Added NoVisor and ThermalVision toggle options in Write Memory.

Fixed some loot issue that was freezing the radar. Test it out.
Hotfix: Forgot to fix some legacy stuff. Yikes.

1.1.11.6

Fix some weird loot on radar.

1.1.11.4

Fixed some container loot being at one place instead of where it should be.

1.1.11.3

Fixed an error where click stop/start button or auto cleanup was not working rendering loot and sometimes player loading not working on new raid or mid raid if button was clicked sometimes.
Made sure Loot table location in memory is always up-to-date.
This helps to keep loot being loaded and not discarded if radar is running and loot is available but when you haven't spawned yet. (Preparing Loot screen)

1.1.11.2

A bit more fixes.

1.1.11.1

Potential loot freeze fix.

1.1.11.0

Some "Jackets" are inaccessible, fix pending. 

Enable and Disable Selected / All menu in Loot List categories.

1.1.10.5

QoL updates. Misc stuff.

1.1.10.2

Live loot.

There is a live loot option in "Loot tab > Setting > LiveLoot checkbox".
Refer to label tooptip for the info on how to use it.

Here is a copy:
	Players and Loot are updated every cycle.

	Player Cycle length = 0.075 second minimum.
	Loot Cycle length = 1 second minimum.

	The more objects to update, the longer cycle is > slower radar.

	Adjust live loot readings per cycle that fits best for you.
	Default value is 40. (i.e. 40 loot objects per 1 second)

	How it works:
	It means that if you got 400 loot objects, they will be updated in about 10 cycles aka 10 seconds.

	Also, you can always press update loot button to speed this up.
	If you don't like live loot, just disable the checkbox and keep clicking the button as you did before.
