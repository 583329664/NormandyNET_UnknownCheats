1.1.12.22

Added options in Other tab:
- Opacity
- Always on Top 

Added options in Overlay tab:
- Moonlight support

Use Fullscreen if playing fullscreen mode via moonlight or Moonlight windowed is you use windowed mode.

Apply right resolution and adjust moonlight window to avoid black bars (Stretch the window diagonally.) 

1.1.12.15

tweak: fake admin button won't show alert every time it's clicked
fix: rust fake admin test is now every 1 second if button is enabled
(that should help on servers where admin state is being reset for some weird reason)

1.1.12.14

Bugfixes

1.1.12.10

Fixed issue with FakeAdmin.
(always check via 'debug.debugcamera' to make sure flag is dropped and you're safe, game changes can be surprising)

I fixed some OpenGL bugs that may help with REDX issue or not. (Lol really I don't have that one so it's pain to fix it.)
Added - OpenGL exception toggle in Debug Tab
If you still keep getting it, tick that and play, the error will popup, I need that error thing.
Try also turning debug log that can generate extra logs.

Keep old version in case this one bugs out.

1.1.12.0

Introduced separate offsets file.
Offsets update shall no longer force end user to redownload the whole application saving download times and server load.
Offsets are applied on the fly and toast will appear on bottom right of the screen.
Any error will simply fallback to the default offsets built in exe so no harm will be done.

For core changes in the app a redownload is still required.
TODO : Different alert for new app version.

1.1.11.12

Offsets
Some more offsets fixed.

1.1.11.10

Fix weapon in hands.

1.1.11.9

Hotfix offsets update.
Again!

1.1.11.8

Hotfix offsets update.
RUST YOU ARE DRUNK GO HOME!

1.1.11.7

New offsets via auto parser.

1.1.11.6

Added option to show house (cupboard authorized players list) owners.
Enabled by default, look in Main tab for appropriate setting.
Authorized players list is refreshed once per 5 minutes.
House/Cupboard is a loot so don't forget to update loot or have live loot enabled for this feature to work.

1.1.10.25

Added Door ESP as per request by one of our users.

New Type under Main tab: ESP
Enabling or disabling that type will show entities of that type on ESP screen in addition to players.
So you can enable ESP category before raiding, estimate the route, where cupboard is, all loot an so on and figure out how much exposives you need to raid it.
Then disable it if you don't need it and keep clean ESP window.

Before this is pushed on site with the new CSV, you need to make sure that CSV file has the following changes:
assets/prefabs/building/door.double.hinged/door.double.hinged.metal.prefab
assets/prefabs/building/door.double.hinged/door.double.hinged.toptier.prefab
assets/prefabs/building/door.double.hinged/door.double.hinged.wood.prefab
assets/prefabs/building/door.hinged/door.hinged.metal.prefab
assets/prefabs/building/door.hinged/door.hinged.toptier.prefab
assets/prefabs/building/door.hinged/door.hinged.wood.prefab

All these should go from Blacklist to ESP category.
There is probably more so I may have missed something, go find out. :)
If you want more items on ESP, you can play around with that and see how it performs on blacklisted items.

Note: Squares are not precise shape.
And all that is a subject to change to improve performance and UI/UX.

1.1.10.24

Fix: Players without a team are marked as teammates.

1.1.10.23

Latest offsets.

1.1.10.22

Fixed : 
- Category list does not show all categories
- Teammate Color UI not working
- If players go to sleep, they don't go into sleep state on radar. 
	(We decreased check cool down a little to make state change faster)
- When players die, they stay marked as alive.
	(Now they have 'Dead' naming like 'Sleepers')

1.1.10.21

Fixed:
- Radar breaking sometimes if you press stop
- Weapons: Not showing on enemies
- Line of Sight - You: Not working
- Sleepers stay on ESP when toggled off
- Toggle off sleepers disables all rendering except players


1.1.10.20

Latest offsets

Improved font rendering speed slightly
Improved icons rendering speed slightly


1.1.10.16

Fixed anti-BSOD performance bottleneck.

1.1.10.14

Potential BSOD fixes.

Semi-fix: lootItems_RUST.csv crashing radar when it is open in editor.
make "lootItems_RUST - Copy.csv" end edit as you like, Radar will copy this file replacing "lootItems_RUST.csv" on restart.

Fix Enable / Disable All menu

1.1.10.9

ESP overlay added. Players / NPC only.

1.1.10.7

Another offset update.

1.1.10.5

QoL updates. Misc stuff.

Live loot expanded to match EFT / DAYZ radars behavior.
Live loot is enabled by default.

There is a live loot option in "Loot tab > Setting > LiveLoot checkbox".
Refer to label tooptip for the info on how to use it.

Here is a copy:
	Players and Loot are updated every cycle.

	Player Cycle length = 0.075 second minimum.
	Loot Cycle length = 1 second minimum.

	The more objects to update, the longer cycle is > slower radar.

	Adjust live loot readings per cycle that fits best for you.
	Default value is 40. (i.e. 40 loot objects per 1 second)

	How it works:
	It means that if you got 400 loot objects, they will be updated in about 10 cycles aka 10 seconds.

	Also, you can always press update loot button to speed this up.
	If you don't like live loot, just disable the checkbox and keep clicking the button as you did before.

1.1.10.3

Another offset update.

1.1.10.2

Sleeping players now can be hidden by ticking 'Show Bodies / Sleeping' under 'Main tab'
Added some checks for sleepers if they log in as well.

Other tab : Map seed and download buttons are obsolete and therefore removed.
Map size apply now works on the fly.

Fix player/npc blinking.

Client rendermap size support:

In rust you can open console by F1 and type: world.rendermap 
This generates a PNG file in Rust folder at "..steamapps\common\Rust"
Like that: map_4500_443983945.png

First part is a map size and second part is seed that is obsolete on custom map server i.e. non prodecural ones.
Take a note of its size, like 4500.
Copy that png file in "\Data_RUST\Alternative" of your radar folder as "map.png".

Start the radar and if you see your position off, then you need to adjust the size.
Go to Other tab - find MapSize, enter the size you took note of and click apply.





1.1.10.1

Fixed players not loading right.

Live loot approach:
  - Loot slowly loads as you go keeping players on a radar non-frozen.
  - Click update loot button to speed this up (this will freeze players until it's done)
  - Animals once loaded, update with 3 second delay to give room for players.

Write Memory tab:
  - Buttons now give you warnings and describe what they do.

Bright day made better.

Fixed garbled nicknames to crash the radar.


1.1.9.8
