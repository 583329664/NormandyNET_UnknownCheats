1.1.12.2

User request:
It is possible to add items to the radar CSV file based on a prefix now. (Test and tell if not working):

You can for example blacklist stuff like "bldr_somebuilding" and add it to blacklist and do that for tons of objects.
It is hard ya know.

Now you can just add "bldr_" and it will blacklist all the items by matched prefix.

1.1.10.5

Live loot.

There is a live loot option in "Loot tab > Setting > LiveLoot checkbox".
Refer to label tooptip for the info on how to use it.

Here is a copy:
	Players and Loot are updated every cycle.

	Player Cycle length = 0.075 second minimum.
	Loot Cycle length = 1 second minimum.

	The more objects to update, the longer cycle is > slower radar.

	Adjust live loot readings per cycle that fits best for you.
	Default value is 40. (i.e. 40 loot objects per 1 second)

	How it works:
	It means that if you got 400 loot objects, they will be updated in about 10 cycles aka 10 seconds.

	Also, you can always press update loot button to speed this up.
	If you don't like live loot, just disable the checkbox and keep clicking the button as you did before.
